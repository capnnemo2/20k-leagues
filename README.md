## Summary

20K Leagues is a digital dive log for scuba divers who are interested in marine life. While there are dive logs that provide more features, we have found that too many features can often be distracting. Instead, 20k Leagues provides the features that divers who are interested in seeing unique and fascinating marine life care about.

With 20k Leagues you can log all of your dives and manage your certifications. In addition, 20k Leagues gives you the ability to track where you spotted some of the most elusive creatures. Not only that, but you have access to where all of our divers have seen these animals. This allows you to record memories of amazing experiences and to get an idea of where to go to see something new.
